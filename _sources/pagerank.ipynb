    "\"Relevant\" and \"quality\" can be hard to define, and they depend on what kind of resources you are searching.\n",

    "Quality usually depends on the links between pages.\n",
    "If there are many links to a particular page, we think it is more likely to be high quality, especially if those links come from pages that are high quality themselves.\n",
