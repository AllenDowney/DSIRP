    "\n",
    "This notebook presents four ways to represent a distribution: PMFs, CDFs, survival functions, and hazard functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "These representations are equivalent in the sense that if you are given any of them, you can compute the others.  So you might wonder why we need four ways to represent the same information.  There are two reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Each representation is useful for computing different values and answering different questions.  In this notebook I'll show you what each representation is good for.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. In some cases we can use a sample to compute a PMF, and use the PMF to compute the other representations.  In other cases it is easier to estimate the hazard function and use it to compute the others.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook I will demonstrate the first process, starting with the PMF.  In the next notebook we'll see the second process, starting with the hazard function."

    "* Probability mass function (PMF), which maps from each value in the distribution to its probability.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Cumulative distribution function (CDF), which maps from each value, `x`, to its cumulative probability, that is, the probability of being less than or equal to `x`.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Survival function, which is the complement of the CDF; that is, the probability of exceeding `x`.\n",
