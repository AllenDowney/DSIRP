    "A [Huffman code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huffman_coding) is a \"type of optimal prefix code that is commonly used for lossless data compression\".\n",
    "There are three parts of that definition we have to unpack: \"code\", \"prefix\", and \"optimal\".\n",
    "\n",
    "In this context, a \"code\" is a mapping from symbols to bit strings.\n",
    "For example, [ASCII](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII) is a character encoding that maps from characters (like letters, numbers, and punctuation) to seven-bit integers.\n",
    "Since all ASCII bit strings are the same length, it is a \"fixed-length code\", as contrasted with Huffman codes, which are \"variable-length codes\".\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to decode something encoded in a variable-length code, there has to be some way to figure out where one bit string ends and the next begins.\n",
    "In general, there are three ways to solve this problem:\n",
    "\n",
    "* One option is to begin each bit string with a special sequence that indicates its length. This is [how Unicode works](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1543613/how-does-utf-8-variable-width-encoding-work).\n",
    "\n",
    "* Another option is to end each bit string with a special sequence that marks the end.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The third option is to use a \"prefix code\", which is how Huffman codes work.\n",
    "\n",
    "A prefix code is a code where no whole bit string in the code is a prefix of any bit string in the code.\n",
    "If a code has this property, we can decode it by reading bits one at a time and checking to see whether we have completed a valid bit string.\n",
    "If so, we know we are at the end of the bit string, because it cannot be the prefix of another bit string.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the following is a prefix code with only three symbols:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "symbol        bit string\n",
    "x             1\n",
    "y             01\n",
    "z             001\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this code, we can encode the string `xyz` with the bit string `101001`, and we can decode the result without ambiguity.\n",
    "\n",
    "So that's what it means to say that a Huffman code is a prefix code; finally, Huffman codes are \"optimal\" in the sense that they give short codes to the most common symbols and longer codes to the least common symbols.\n",
    "The result is that they minimize the average number of bits needed to encode a sequence of symbols.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, in order to achieve this feat, we have to know the relative frequencies of the symbols.\n",
    "One way to do that is to start with a \"corpus\", which is a text that contains the symbols in the proportions we expect for the text we will encode.\n",
    "\n",
    "As an example, I'll use the text from the [Huffman code Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huffman_coding)."
