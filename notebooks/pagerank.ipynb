    "The goal of information retrieval is to find resources that are relevant and high quality.\n",
    "\"Relevant\" and \"quality\" can be hard to define, and they depend on what kind of resources you are searching.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of web search, relevance usually depends on the contents of a web page: if a web page contains the search terms, we assume that it is relevant to the search terms.\n",
    "\n",
    "Quality usually depends on the links between pages.\n",
    "If there are many links to a particular page, we think it is more likely to be high quality, especially if those links come from pages that are high quality themselves.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the first algorithms to quantify quality in this is PageRank, which was the core of Google's original search engine.\n",
    "As someone who used earlier search engines, like Alta Vista, I can tell you first-hand what a big difference it made.\n",

    "\n",
    "To avoid that, we'll modify the random walk so at every step there is some probability that the walker jumps to a random node rather than following a link.\n",
