    "slower if the structure doesn't fit in cache but still fits in memory;\n",
    "and *much* slower if the structure doesn't fit in memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another limitation of this implementation is that hashing doesn't help\n",
    "if we are given a value rather than a key: `containsValue` is linear\n",
    "because it has to search all of the sub-maps. And there is no\n",
    "particularly efficient way to look up a value and find the corresponding\n",
    "key (or possibly keys).\n",
