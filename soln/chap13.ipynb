    "The second solution is better, and there are several ways to do it. The\n",
    "most common is to modify `put` so that it detects when the tree is\n",
    "starting to become unbalanced and, if so, rearranges the nodes. Trees\n",
    "with this capability are called \"self-balancing\". Common self-balancing\n",
    "trees include the AVL tree (\"AVL\" are the initials of the inventors),\n",
    "and the red-black tree, which is what the Java `TreeMap` uses.\n",

    "In our example code, if we replace `MyTreeMap` with the Java `TreeMap`,\n",

    "In the previous exercise you didn't have to implement `remove`, but you\n",
    "might want to try it. If you remove a node from the middle of the tree,\n",
    "you have to rearrange the remaining nodes to restore the BST property.\n",
    "You can probably figure out how to do that on your own, or you can read\n",
    "the explanation at <http://thinkdast.com/bstdel>.\n",
    "\n",
    "Removing a node and rebalancing a tree are similar operations: if you do\n",
